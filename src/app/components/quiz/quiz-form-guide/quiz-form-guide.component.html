        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          This guide aims to show you how to create and edit a quiz on Quiz World.
          You will learn the following things:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The "anatomy" of a quiz (such as what instant mode is)</li>
          <li>How to add and remove questions from your quiz, as well as manage their answers</li>
          <li>Guidance on how to create good and fun quizzes that users will like and engage with</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This guide does not assume any prior knowledge about quizzes in general&mdash;so do not worry
          if this is your time creating a quiz!
        </p>
        <p>
          The guide is aimed mostly at creating quizzes, but most of the functionalities
          are applicable when editing the quiz too. However, some options
          may not be available when editing the quiz; in such cases, you
          will have to recreate the quiz anew.

        <h3>Overview of quizzes</h3>
        <p>Quizzes consist of the following elements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Title</strong> - the title is the first thing the user is going to see in most cases
            and serves as a quick way to gauge what the quiz is all about. Therefore,
            coming up with an interesting title is important if you want users
            to play your quiz.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Description</strong> - the description provides extra information
            that users may need to know. This includes things like rules in regards to
            answer formatting, more specific scope of the topic, and many other things.
            In short, the description provides important information to users that have
            displayed an interest in playing your quiz.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Game mode</strong> - a quiz can currently be in <em>default mode</em>
            or <em>instant mode</em>. By default, a user must give an answer to each question
            to see how many questions they got right. In instant mode, however,
            users can see if they got a question right after giving an answer to the
            question&mdash;they do not need to go through the entire quiz to
            check if their answer was correct. Please note that the game mode
            <strong>cannot</strong> be edited, so proceed with caution!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Questions</strong> - each quiz has between one and 100 questions,
            each consisting of answers that can be correct or incorrect.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>The process of quiz creation</h4>
        <p>
          The process goes through three steps. You can go to the next
          step only when everything is valid in the step before it.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Provide a title and a description for your quiz. Optionally, make
            the quiz operate in instant mode.
          </li>
          <li>
            Insert the questions you would like users to answer, as well as their
            correct answers. Depending on the type of question,
            you may also have the option or be required to provide answers
            that are considered incorrect.
          </li>
          <li>
            Submit the quiz and enjoy your creation!
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Note that questions are displayed to the user in the exact order you place them
          in the form, so be careful if the order is needed to make for a better experience.
          On the contrary, though, the answers are shuffled every time the user plays
          the quiz, so do not rely on the answer order in any capacity!
        </p>

      <mat-tab label="Creating questions">
        <img ngSrc="/images/creating-questions.svg" alt="" priority [width]="320" [height]="320 / 1.42" />
        <h3>Creating questions</h3>
        <p>
          Questions and their answers are the founding elements of any quiz,
          so they must be given special care in order to create a good quiz.
          Each quiz has at least one question and no more than 100 questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          To add a new question, you can click the respective button at the bottom of the page.
          On the top right corner of each question can also be found a button that
          will delete the respective question when clicked
          (note that this is irreversible&mdash;you will have to add the question again
          if you change your mind).
        </p>
        <p>
          Each question also has buttons that allow you to add
          answers those questions, as well as remove them. Note that they
          are only visible in certain cases. For example, you won't
          be able to remove the only answer to the question!
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, each question allows you to provide "notes". Notes
          contain bits of information that are displayed to the user
          after they have answered a question. These can be used to
          achieve a few things:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Explain why certain answer(s) is/are correct or incorrect</li>
          <li>Provide interesting details regarding the question</li>
          <li>Provide external links that go into more detail regarding the question</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Types of questions</h4>
        <p>Quiz World currently supports three types of questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Single-choice</strong>: several answers provided, of which
            only one is correct
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Multiple-choice</strong>: several answers provided, of
            which <em>at least one</em> is correct. It is possible for there
            to be more than one correct answer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Text</strong>: the user must input the correct answer
            in the provided text field.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The type of each question can be changed with a dropdown menu that is
          provided with each question. When switching to a different type,
          the form will try its best to make the current answers compatible with
          the type. For example, if you change a multiple-choice question to a text one,
          all correct answers will be kept, while all incorrect answers will be removed.
        </p>
        <p>Read below for more detailed explanation of each type of question.</p>
        <h5>Single-choice question</h5>
        <p>
          Single-choice questions give the player between two and ten answers.
          The user can select only one answer, thus all single-choice questions
          have only one correct answer. This is similar to most exams you take
          in schools.
        </p>
        <h5>Multiple-choice questions</h5>
        <p>
          Multiple-choice questions give the player between two and ten answers,
          of which at least one is correct. It is possible for a multiple-choice
          question to have more than one correct answer. In fact, it is even
          possible for a question to have no incorrect answers at all!
        </p>
        <p>
          The player is considered to have answered the question correctly
          if they have selected all correct answers. Missing a correct answer
          or selecting at least one incorrect answer will result in a failure.
        </p>
        <h5>Text questions</h5>
        <p>
          Text questions give the player a text field in which they must type
          a correct answer. Text questions thus require answers
          that are very specific (e.g. year dates and names).
        </p>
        <p>
          Text questions can have up to 15 correct answers. You should generally
          provide any alternative spelling / variation of a correct answer.
          For example, if the question's answer is the United States,
          you can provide the other common names of the country, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>US</li>
          <li>USA</li>
          <li>United States of America</li>
          <li>and so on...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The player is considered to have answered correctly if they
          type in one of the correct answers. The answer comparison
          is case- and space-insensitive (thus <code> CA n  ada</code> is the same as <code>canada</code>).
          Thus, you, as the creator of the quiz, can simply add "Canada"
          as the correct answer (and not <code>CAN A DA   </code>). Spelling
          it properly is important because all correct answers are displayed
          after the player has answered the question correctly and they
          are displayed the way you have spelled them, so you don't want
          people to think you are an idiot!

        <h3>Good practices</h3>
        <p>
          Certain practices can make your quiz more enjoyable for other players.
          Likewise, certain practices can worsen the experience, so those
          should be avoided.
        </p>
        <h4>General</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Use instant mode when possible</strong> - users
            are more likely to play through the entire quiz (particularly
            if it's a large one) if they receive feedback sooner.
            This gives them the feeling that they are progressing
            faster than if they had to go through the entire quiz
            to get an idea about their performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stick to one topic</strong> - while technically
            nothing stops you from creating quizzes pertaining to
            more than one topic (e.g. chess and food), users are
            more likely to play a quiz pertaining exclusively to
            their topic of interest.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proceed with caution when adding obscure questions</strong> -
            questions which are very hard to answer (mostly due to requiring very
            specific knowledge that few people will possess) may upset some players,
            making them more likely to leave your quiz midway. Of course, this isn't
            always going to be case&mdash;some quizzes are made to be specifically hard,
            appealing to users that may want to play such.
            All in all, consider carefully whether you want to add super difficult
            questions to your quizz
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Text questions</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Be specific</strong> - there should be
            no ambiguity in regards to what the player has to input.
            For example, "Where was Michael Jackson born?" is problematic,
            because the continent, country, city, or even the hospital he was born
            in could be the correct answer! Instead, ask
            "In which city was Michael Jackson born?"
          </li>
